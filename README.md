# Aldi SÃ¼d Assignment by Hatim

Welcome to the ALDI Store Dashboard! This dashboard aims to help the imaginary grocery store chain detect sales, profit and customer demographics by providing insights into their data. The data used for this dashboard can be found in the "Sample - Superstore.xlsx" file.

## Features

- [Home]: This feature give you a overview of the data with sales analytics, profit analytics and customer demographics
- [Table]: This features display the table data with dropdown filters, date filters and you can dynamically add data to your dashboard with some validation.
- [Graph]: The graph page displays the 2 plots.
- 1.   On the left side of the page, we have a fitting timeline graph for the following properties: Days to Ship, Discount, Profit, Profit Ratio, Quantity, Returns, Sales
- 2.   On the right side of the page, we have a Bubble chart that include two-axis dropdowns containing the
following properties: Days to Ship, Discount, Profit, Profit Ratio, Quantity, Returns, Sales.
By selecting one dropdown, the option should be excluded in the other. Also we have a third dropdown that breaks down the bubble chart and contains the following properties: Segment, Ship Mode, Customer Name, Category, SubCategory, Product Name
